1.LINUX
Linux is an operating system, which is a powerful and flexible open-source software platform. Developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991.Linux is well-known for its reliability, safety, and flexibility, allows users to customize and improve their environment to suit specific needs. For servers and developers, it is the ideal option because it offers strong security, stability, and performance. One of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system.

Linux offers a wide range of distributions for different users:
1.Ubuntu a Linux distribution developed and regularly updated by Canonical.
2. Fedora is the Linux created by Red Hat. It is a distribution os that focuses on all the updates or security innovation updates on the market related to os.
3. Debian is a popular and widely-used operating system in the Linux family.
4. Arch Linux is a distribution known for its simplicity, adaptability, and customizability.
5.CentOS, It is also free and open-source, created by Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
    6. Linux Mint is a distribution that is known for its user-friendly interface and ease of use.
7. OpenSUSE distribution provides a stable and secure environment for businesses and desktops.
8. Kali Linux is a specialized distribution designed for ethical hacking and cybersecurity purposes.
9. RHEL, As a leading enterprise Linux distribution, RHEL prioritizes stability, security, and long-term support.
Etc.
2.KERNAL
A kernel is the core part of an Operating System, it is like system software which is an important component of the operating system. It generally has complete control over everything. Kernal is  responsible for managing the system's resources and enabling communication between hardware and software. The kernel is the bridge between applications and hardware. It is crucial for system performance, stability, and security.

Types of Kernels:
1.Monolithic Kernel:
All OS services run in kernel space.

Fast but can be less stable (e.g., Linux kernel).

2.Microkernel:

Only essential services run in kernel space; others run in user space.

More modular and stable, but might be slower (e.g., Minix, QNX).

3.Hybrid Kernel:

Combines aspects of both monolithic and microkernels (e.g., Windows NT kernel, macOS XNU).

Key Functions of the Kernel:
1.Process Management

a.	Handles creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.

b.	Manages multitasking and CPU time allocation.

2.Memory Management

a.	Allocates and deallocates memory space as needed.

b.	Maintains memory protection and virtual memory.

3.Device Management

a.	Controls and communicates with hardware devices through device drivers.

4.File System Management

a.	Manages data storage, file access permissions, and directory structures.


3.Boot Procedure.

The boot procedure in an operating system is the process your computer follows to start up and load the OS into memory after it's powered on or restarted. Here's a clear step-by-step breakdown of the booting process:

1. Power-On and POST (Power-On Self Test)
When the computer is powered on, the CPU is initialized.The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (modern firmware) performs POST.POST checks basic hardware like RAM, keyboard, and storage devices for functionality.

üíæ 2. BIOS/UEFI Initialization
After POST, the BIOS/UEFI looks for a bootable device (HDD, SSD, USB, CD/DVD).

It checks the boot order set in firmware settings to find the correct device.

üß† 3. Bootloader is Loaded
The BIOS/UEFI loads the bootloader from the Master Boot Record (MBR) or EFI System Partition (ESP) of the boot device.

The bootloader (like GRUB for Linux or BOOTMGR for Windows) is a small program responsible for loading the OS.

‚öôÔ∏è 4. OS Kernel is Loaded
The bootloader loads the kernel of the operating system into RAM.

It also passes control to the kernel along with system parameters.

üì¶ 5. Kernel Initialization
The kernel sets up core system functions:

Initializes hardware drivers

Mounts the root filesystem

Starts memory and process management

üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 6. Init System or System Manager Starts 
The kernel starts the init system:

init, systemd (Linux)

launchd (macOS)

wininit.exe (Windows)

This process starts user-space services and background daemons.

üñ•Ô∏è 7. User Interface (Login Prompt/Desktop)
Finally, the Graphical User Interface (GUI) or command-line login screen appears.
